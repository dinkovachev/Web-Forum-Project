Sod that promotion and relegation nonsense, it\'s averageness that is truly to be celebrated, and no-one can be more average than the winner of the mid-table trophy.

A reminder of the rules:

First team to hit the beach, whereby you\'re too crap to stand any chance mathematically of going up, but you\'re not crap enough to be able to go down.
In the event of a tie (which is pretty common, especially in a league stuffed with such utterly average teams), the winner is crowned by having the GD that is closest to zero, to reflect TRUE mediocrity.
If that\'s still a tie, then the team closest to the sacred mid-table havens of 12th or 13th.
...and if that STILL hasn\'t decided it, then the team with the most draws.
There are some who believe in the "first past the post" method of determining this, but I think that\'s far too open to abuse and swings far too arbitrarily on one game - what happens if it\'s a late kick-off or something?
